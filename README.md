# Random Rants - Chat Echoing Server

The message echoing server for Random Rants.

## How it works

When a JSON message is sent, every client gets the message.

## Security Notice

Security is not the best here.
Anyone that connects to this server can send anything in JSON format which can be used to manipulate a user.
This was exploited many times before, be aware of this problem.
This is because Random Rants is based on Gvbvdxx Chat's source code.
