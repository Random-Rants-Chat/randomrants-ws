      Random Rants - Chat Echoing Server
    </h1>
    <p>The message echoing server for Random Rants.</p>
    <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
    <p>When a JSON message is sent, every client gets the message.</p>
    <h2 id="security-notice">Security Notice</h2>
    <p>
      Security is not the best here. Anyone that connects to this server can
      send anything in JSON format which can be used to manipulate a user. This
      was exploited many times before, be aware of this problem. This is because
      Random Rants is based on Gvbvdxx Chat&#39;s source code.
